## Appendix B. Error Details Map (Informative)
- Band allocation is defined in Section 7.10.1 (Normative). Individual subcode mappings (numbers, messages, guidance) are canonical in `docs/errors.md` (Informative, generated from `internal/envseed/errors.go`). This appendix intentionally remains concise.
  - Error identifiers use the `EVE-<exit>-<subcode>` label format (see Section 7.11) to improve searchability and cross-referencing.
